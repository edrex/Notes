====== GettingStarted ======
Created Friday 05 April 2019

I want to start using Ansible for my personal infrastructure, but applying it to existing systems is complicated.

[ ] Adopt dotfiles repo for ansible? or fresh one? 

===== Plan =====

1. Use ansible to configure a fresh machine, [[RaspberryPi]] from the start
2. Follow up by configuring Bookmobile using ansible (also from scratch I think)
3. Once I have a configuration repo, follow up by porting laptop config to ansible and use it going forward
