For example, http://allmende.io/ self-describes as digital commons.

Does this analogy to common land hold up?

One difference is that a server must be continually maintained (provided with power, rack rents, security updates, etc) to continue to provide value to people
I think in many ways clearly not, since land generally requires no maintenance to continue to exist
