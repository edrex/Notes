====== Laptop ======
Created Saturday 27 April 2019

When I open my laptop, what do I see? Browser tabs.

What was I thinking just before I opened my laptop? Either:
a. I would like  to perform some specific task, such as writing or configuring a software component.
b. I just want to "surf"  ; or I may have been thinking nothing at all, just reaching for the laptop out of dead habit.
