Hi, my company sells and manages decentralized internet services.

We are evaluating newer generation boards with good compute and IO, with USB-C/3.1 as the base for our next gen appliances.

Does the RK3399 run mainline Linux yet, or only Android? Both are of interest.

We are interested in a sample board to evaluate. 

Regards,
