<h1>UserProgrammingEnvironmentWithBuiltinCustomizationMarketPlace</h1>
<p>Created Tuesday 16 April 2019</p>
<p><a href="../UserProgrammingEnvironments">:UserProgrammingEnvironments</a> are great. They allow end users to customize the functioning of their tools at runtime by writing code, sometimes in the form of a <a href="../GraphicalBlockLanguage.html">:GraphicalBlockLanguage.</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, though, users may want functionality that isn’t available in the standard palette of blocks, and that would be too complicated to build up from primatives, given their skill level.</p>
<p>What if the environment was connected to a marketplace so that the user could provide some examples of the desired output and get someone online to implement it?</p>
<p>That’s all I got for now. <a href="../NeedsPrototype.html">:NeedsPrototype</a></p>
