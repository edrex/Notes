<h1>Return phone</h1>
<p>Device received has several marks of use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside of USB micro port is very dirty, indicating that the phone was in dirty environments for an extended period.</li>
<li>Screen bezel is damaged at one corner from a prying instrument. Apparently the device was opened up for service (screen replacement perhaps?) which makes it very much not a “New” device.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is clearly a used device, therefore I would like to return it for a full refund, with Seller paying return shipping.</p>
