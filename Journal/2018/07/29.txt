you can use a disk usage analyzer (eg, baobab for gnome) to figure out what's taking space. 42GB seems a lot for a few hundred pdfs, unless they are all fat textbook scans.
you probably want to put them on a server and just access them when you need them. Syncthing isn't a panacea. there are other complementary tools like nextcloud.
Be careful with syncthing if you have to manually intervene. Deletes propogate. If you use syncthing as a backup solution you should have versioning turned on in at least one copy (the server copy usually).

the line i posted previously will cause zim to fail to start. the correct line to add to ~/.profile is 
export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$HOME/.nix-profile/share:$HOME/.share:/usr/share

i'm looking for good videos on nonviolent communication.
