Single source of truth way of sharing
	instead of all of us puting our changes into one big pool

Most non-standard(decentralized like GIT, IPFS, Camley store), transform them into internal format so if you want to get to data, you have to translate that systemss files
	can mount the filesystems
	twice as much space
	checked out copy and internal copy
DAT indexes your files on disk 
	translate into content adressable storage, etc
can take directory that takes TB storage
	has to scan all files in disk
	has indext that points to files on disk
	run DAT node all the time
	looks at all your shares
	publisher and subscriber
	you are either writer or subscriber
		only one writer logically, one key
		if you add files to share have to be writer
