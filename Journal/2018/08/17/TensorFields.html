<h1>TensorFields</h1>
<p>Created Friday 17 August 2018 prototypical example, famous quote from physicist, kipp thorne maybe, ~fields tell particles how to move, and particles tell fields what shape to be some particles generate a particular type of field electro-magnetic field strong/weak nuclear force strong &gt; weak &gt; electro-magnetic many orders of magnetude of effect confinement only capable of binding sub-atomic particles these are weaving thier own fields, and they interact based on what fields they have dominant producers of that type of field as you zoom in, all you see is their field particles are interacting with eachother with eachothers fields if you send a pulse/wave across a field, oscillating particles photons light portion of light mediating vehicle leptons are the field, produced by wave-like motions in the field</p>
