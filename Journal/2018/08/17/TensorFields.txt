prototypical example, famous quote from physicist, kipp thorne maybe, ~fields tell particles how to move, and particles tell fields what shape to be
	some particles generate a particular type of field
		electro-magnetic field
		strong/weak nuclear force
			strong > weak > electro-magnetic
				many orders of magnetude of effect
				confinement
					only capable of binding sub-atomic particles
	these are weaving thier own fields, and they interact based on what fields they have
		dominant producers of that type of field
			as you zoom in, all you see is their field
		particles are interacting with eachother with eachoters fields
		if you send a pulse/wave across a field, oscillating
			particles
			photons light por
