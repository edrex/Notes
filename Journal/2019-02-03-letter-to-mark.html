<p>Hi Mark. Can we talk? She wrecked a lot of havoc in my life, and she’srecently been threatening to make public abuse accusations against me, which are unfounded, but she I traveled and cohabitated with Lovi for about a month last summer (in three sessions) and quickly realized that she has a tendancy to get very upset</p>
<p>experienced some very problematic behavior (threats and emotional abuse to get me to I haven’t historically been great about reaching out to help with social and emotional issues</p>
<p>I think you know that I spent some time with Lovi this Summer. You were her friend and benifactor for awhile, and at some point she told me she had a falling.</p>
<p>I want to talk with you about my experiences with Lovi. I have found that I don’t feel safe talking with her 1-1, because she frequently makes threats and otherwise tries to coerce me into going along with her will.</p>
<p>I need to talk about some traumatic things that went on between Lovi and I last Summer and early Fall.</p>
