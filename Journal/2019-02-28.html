<p>Opening my laptop presents too many distractions when I’m here to write.</p>
<p>This is because of the many research tabs I keep around to organize active tasks. I organize tabs heirarchically, window collecting tabs relating to a particular research topic/task, then each workspace grouping windows by context (research, communications, writing, systems administration). Most tabs are only acting as a temporary bookmark for a URL, while others contain draft input or terminal sessions etc.</p>
<p>This has some shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pruning non-active tasks is a manual process, usually involving copying the URLs of the tabs in a given browser window to my personal wiki.</li>
<li>Consequently, I often have a backlog of tabs I Superficially, I need a way to quickly clear my desk so I can focus on writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why not just close everything?</p>
<p>Well, I’m using open windows to keep track of multiple active research contexts.For example, among the 150 or so tabs I currently have open are windows containing research into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recreational access to isolated BLM land tracts in Southern Oregon (for hiking/MTB)</li>
<li>Readings in cryptography (foundational papers like Diffie-Hellmann, RSA, Merkle, etc)</li>
<li>Building a WebExtension for storing my browsing data to a personal server.</li>
<li>Materials for an online course in digital signal processing I am taking.</li>
</ul>
<p>My current approach to pruning this context is to manually move the tabs into a text-based wiki organized by topic. This splits my context across two levels: short-term (tabs and windows) and long (wiki pages), which works reasonably well.</p>
<p>I’ve long wanted to streamline this process though.</p>
<p>. If I close them I lose</p>
<p>One problem is I’m using open tabs as context. I need an efficient way to organize resources into contexts, so i can open and close contexts instead of resources.</p>
