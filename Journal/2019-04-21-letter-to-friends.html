<h2>Outline:</h2>
<ul>
<li>writing to let you know what I’ve been up to the past year or so</li>
<li>learning new skills</li>
<li>processing</li>
</ul>
<p>( - need for a social practice for maintaining long distance casual relationships over time - Enter letter writing! - But we’re all very busy and have large (monkeysphere-size) remote networks (rather than local networks of the same size as it was in the past) - Newsletter! Write a single high-quality letter occasionally (say, quarterly)</p>
<p>) - What I’ve been up to - Took an 18mo hiatus from tech to evaluate my own ethics and and evaluate the ethics of the industry. I have been connecting with other determined technologists around the world working on freedom-preserving alternatives to the current dominant systems. -</p>
<pre><code>looking at the ethical frameworks present at the genesis of our current digital technologies</code></pre>
<p>Hi, I’m writing let you all know what I’ve been up to for the past year or so.</p>
<p>Like many of us, I had become dependent on centralized social data silos for keeping up with my friends, and when most of us stopped updating those silos I lost track of you all.</p>
