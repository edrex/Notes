<p>Woke up at unexpectedly at 4am</p>
<p>Creative thoughts, usually not captured, because capture requires engaging with the SEA OF DISTRACTION.</p>
<p>I decide the attempt idea capture.</p>

<h2>Journaling at 4am with the lights off</h2>
<p>I don’t want to open a laptop, becase THE SEA will rush in, but I don’t have any other mode of capture I am habituated to (ie, paper), so I decide to risk it. I almost turn the lights on, but decide against it.Sensory deprevation is great for writing (if you are constantly overstimulated by the world, like me).</p>
<p>Augghh the screen, it burns my eyes, and the sea of icons, text, and media already present threaten to sear my brain!), so I act quickly: - with eyes averted I - Switch to terminal workspace - full screen terminal window - dim the screen: <code>sudo echo 130 &gt; /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness</code> - Type <code>journal</code> - Zoom waaaay in - set keyboard brightness to zero - cover the laptop charging light with the lip of my laptop stand</p>
<p>ahh, that’s better - TODO: automate those steps and bind to a keyboard - QUESTION: does my laptop have an ambient light sensor I can query?</p>
<p>As I start to write, I immediately notice that I can’t perform basic tasks without seeing the keycaps.</p>
<ul>
<li>My touch typing is terrible (wrong fingers all over the place, lots of hunt-and-peck</li>
<li>Finding symbol keys (important for movement in VIM) requires lots of trial and error</li>
<li>I am terrible at movement in vim
<ul>
<li>hjkl movement
<ul>
<li>beginning/end of line</li>
<li>prev/next word</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />
When I go to research the ambient light question, I notice that browsing the web stabs me in the eyes with white backgrounds WISH: always-dark background - Could be accomplished with a compositor extension that takes a global avg pixel value and inverts the frame if it’s above 50% - Asked in sway channel if there’s any work to support compositor plugins - [x] Was recommended to try Dark Reader addon for firefox, which works!<ul>
