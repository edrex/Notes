<p>I just got back from a 3-day late-season backpacking trip in Rogue Wilderness. I took advantage of a warm and dry spell, and only got rained on the last couple hours before I got back to the van.</p>
<p>I did the Wild Rogue Loop hike:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started in Marial, at the (free) Tucker Flat Campground</li>
<li>Hiked about 4000ft up West Mule Creek, over many downed trees.</li>
<li>Camped at the intersection with Buck Creek / NF-230.</li>
<li>In the morning took a 1mi side trip to fetch water from Buck Creek. As it happened there was a teensy bit of water in one of the streams later in the day, but that is seasonal and I had no way to know.</li>
<li>Hiked up to Hanging Rock then along Panther Ridge, and down the steep Clay Hill. It was very slick with dry oak leaves so I was happy for my trekking poles.</li>
<li>Had a lovely beach camp at one of the established sites East of Clay Hill.</li>
<li>In the morning, hustled up the river, donning my trash-bag poncho whenever it started to rain, passing the occasional rafting group. The river is beautiful, the build-up that comes with the rafters I could do without.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to highlight CalTopo, a map making and sharing tool I discovered while researching this trip. It seems to be the love labor of a single person. Standout features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Excellent set of layers, including the best Land Management layer I’ve seen (so you can tell BLM from Weyerhauser etc).</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of Hiker maps: <a href="https://caltopo.com/m/V4UP.html">Siskiyou Mountains Trail Finder</a> ### Route info</p></li>
