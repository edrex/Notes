<p>Yesterday I gave the <a href="../Cassita/Insulation.html">Cassita Insulation</a> a serious upgrade, covering the exposed cement footing and 2x sill plate with 2" of polyiso foam board.</p>
<p>The footing + base board comprise 14" x 40â€™ = 46.5 ft^2 of conductive surface in thermal contact with the outside, so with the attic and the exterior door dealt with, it was the next priority.</p>
<p>I glued it up with exterior-grade silicon calk and 2 cans of spray foam, resulting in a snug, relatively draft-free fit.</p>
<p>I was very happy with the result, with the standing temp immediately jumping from ~62F to ~67F! The cassita is finally a comfortable winter living space. No more frosty morning toes!</p>
