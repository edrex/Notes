<h1>Tuesday 12 Mar 2019</h1>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Zim is wack but temporarily tolerable because it exports to markdown via pandoc</p>
<p>I’m on a hilltop (see chronologically correlated video in stream) writing and thinking about how to make my voice heard.</p>
<p>I’ve had pneumonia for at least 6, maybe 8 weeks. What a hard winter. Learning to take care of myself after half a decade relying on another person for basic comfort.</p>
<p>I need to secure some income ASAP, but would like to stay “indie” if I can.</p>
