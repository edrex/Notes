Hi!

Zim is wack but tolerable because it exports to markdown view pandoc

I'm on a hilltop (see chronologically correlated video in stream) writing and thinking about how to make my voice heard.

I've had pneumonia for at least 6, maybe 8 weeks. What a hard winter. Learning to take care of myself after too long relying on another person for basic comfort.
