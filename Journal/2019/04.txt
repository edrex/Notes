What a lovely month in Southern Oregon! A mix of sunshine and rain leads to everything turning green.

My mom travelled to North Idaho to visit her sisters, eldest son, and daughter, so I had my run of the house for a week. I hadn't realized how much she had been sapping my attention till she wasn't there.

Some highlights:

* Rode two challenging gravel summits both of which had elements of [[:BikeWhacking]]
	* Rice Creek to BLM to Kent Creek [[03:31|Sunday]]
	* Roberts Mountain transit [[+04|Thursday]]
* Took the dogs on some adventures
	* Two river trips (the Happy Valley boat ramp [[+01|Monday]] and Winston's River Bend Park, which has a beautiful, underused beach, [[+03|Wednesday]])
	* Long hike up the nearby hill, with my customary [[:WorkFromHilltop]] [[+05|Friday]]
* Set up this personal notebook to auto publish ( [[:Zim:Publish]] ) [[+05|Thursday]] which is a big step towards my goal of making online communication without [[:CorporateCloud]] [[:LowFriction]]
