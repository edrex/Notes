What a lovely month in Southern Oregon! A mix of sunshine and rain leads to everything turning green.

My mom travelled to North Idaho to visit her sisters, eldest son, and daughter, so I had my run of the house for a week. I hadn't realized how much she had been sapping my attention till she wasn't there.

Some highlightI went on several challenging gravel summit rides.
