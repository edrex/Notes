@aral@mastodon.ar.al I bounce around with note systems a lot (which causes so much workflow disruption!) but I've been using Zim for awhile. It's not minimal but it has some attributes I value highly:

+WikiLinking
+tight capture/view feedback loop (via wysiwyg) vs something like MD and a static site compiler
+SingleActiveWindow (avoids tab proliferation)
+ Export to HTML
+GTK3 now, so I can use it with Broadway on my phone etc (theoretically, just now testing)
