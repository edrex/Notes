<h1>13</h1>
<p>Created Saturday 13 July 2019 Any recommendations no-fee camping near 14 East of Stevenson?</p>
<p>I’m heading out to the gorge to camp for a few days and I want to stay near 14 to meet my mom and aunt as they drive back from Idaho tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>PS I’ll be back in PDX for Foster Night Ride Tuesday, then down to Southern OR for a week.</p>
<p>So yeah, we hadn’t talked really since UCC days but she had a series of unfortunate events and is living in hotels and nearly broke and she needs a couch for a bit, maybe till she gets paid next Friday.</p>
<p>What I learned: She works as a gate agent for Iceland Air. She was living in TIgard but wanted to live closer in so she signed a lease on a goose hollow apt and gave notice, then they backed out and asked for a larger deposit that she couldn’t afford, so she has been staying in hotels by the airport since around the 1st. Then a day or two ago she had $350 stolen from her room and the same hotel charged her $250 for having an unregistered cat. She recently had a breakup and her ex got the car so she’s getting around by transit. She says her cat is trained as a travel cat and is tidy.</p>
<p>It sounds like she is on the verge of becoming homeless and really needs friends. I don’t know how willing you are to get involved with her but I figured I’d reach out to you and maybe you’d have some ideas. I’m van camping and pretty broke so all I can offer her is advice and my network right now.</p>
