Eric and Linda have offered to drive, there's room for all of us on this email list and our bikes. 

If you're not coming from Portland, we might be able to stop at a train station on the way to scoop you up.

I've spent a good amount of time researching and creating the below routes.  They are still in development, so if you copy them to your own RideWithGPS account, please know they may change before we go.  If you have intel on any of the areas we're riding in, or any other route feedback, please send it on over!
