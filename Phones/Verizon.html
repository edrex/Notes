<h2>Chat log 2019-09-19</h2>
<p>Christopher: Hi! Before you leave, I would be happy to assist you with your order. You: i have a question about sim card compatibility.

We’ll be with you shortly. Christopher: Welcome to Verizon Wireless Sales Chat, I’ll be happy to help answer your questions and get your order placed today! Christopher: With whom do I have the pleasure of chatting? You: Hey, I just have a quick question about sim compatibility. Can you see my previous messages? Christopher: Yes, i just read them. If you card is compatible, and you were taken to check out,you will be good to go! If your SIM is not compatible, a free one will be sent to you automatically. Did you bring your own device over as well? You: Is there a way to tell whether it deemed it compatibile or not? yes. I want to port a number and I want to time the new service activation to maximize the service period on my previous plan. If I have to wait for a new sim to be sent in the mail, I need to plan for that. You: yes, bringing my own device Christopher: Ok, I understand! How much longer do you have on your last month with Straight talk? You: A week, service end date is September 26 Christopher: Ok, perfect. Here is what we can do Christopher: ; Christopher: I have just checked with my supervisor, since you went straight to check out, that means your SIM is compatible! You: ok, thanks for your help. I’ll wait to purchase service till a couple of days before my old plan ends. Have a good one! Christopher: So let’s go ahead and choose for you to get a new SIM card. This way, it will arrive on the 24 th and you won’t have to put it in until the 27th after your Straight Talk device has expired! You: Can I schedule my service start date for after the purchase? You: Didn’t you say my SIM is compatible? You: <em>confused</em> Christopher: Yes, your SIM is compatible, but competition of the order today may affect your service with straight talk, so I recommend choosing to get a new SIM. It’s free and you will just have to switch SIMs out when you are ready and your phone will activate on out Network. You: Will my billing period start today or when I put the new sim in? You: I know you have metrics to meet, and you probably get dinged if I don’t make a purchase today, but I was really just researching and planning to make the purchase next week. You: But if there’s a way to have the billing period start later, I would order today Christopher: Your billing will begin the day you activate and put the new SIM in. There is no need to rush into anything! I understand wanting to have all your facts straightened out before purchasing! You: Ok, so if I order and pay today there is an additional activation step where I request the number port, which I can do just before I put the sim in? Christopher: Correct, before you enter your payment information, there should be the option to keep your current phone number. You: but the port won’t happen and billing period won’t start till I request an additional activation step? Christopher: Sort of. You won’t need to request anything, The billing and the number port will not happen until you activate onto our Network. In order to forthat, you will simply replace the SIM then port your phone back on with the ew SIM. You: oh! That’s great. I’m just always expecting hidden gotchas. Ok, I’ll go ahead and place my order. Thanks for the clear answers Christopher: You are very welcome! I ’ll hang out in case you have any more questions or issues. (: Christopher: Just checking in, how is everything going? Christopher: Were you able to get hte new SIM card added ok? Christopher: the* Christopher: Just checking in, how is everything going?</p>
