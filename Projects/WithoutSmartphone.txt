====== WithoutSmartphone ======
Created Friday 03 May 2019

I want to live without a standard smartphone.

They sacrifice too much control to large corps, who abuse it to steal my attention.
I don't want to be constantly connected, only when i choose to be.

===== Idea =====

* USB LTE modem
* SBC + screen module + battery pack
* Camera?

==== Criteria ====
* Touch would be nice

* Portability (battery etc)
