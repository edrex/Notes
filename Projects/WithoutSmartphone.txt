====== WithoutSmartphone ======
Created Friday 03 May 2019

I want to live without a standard smartphone.

They sacrifice too much control to large corps, who abuse it to steal my attention.
I don't want to be constantly connected, only when i choose to be.

===== Idea =====

* USB LTE modem
* SBC + screen module + battery pack
* Camera?

===== Modem =====

===== Screen =====

==== Criteria ====
* Touch would be nice
* Size
* Portability (battery etc)
* [[:eInk]] would be cool, expensive and only one vendor afaik though


==== Connection types ====
* USB C
* HDMI (with battery or USB power)


===== SBC =====
* Pi
* Something beefier with USB-C
* GPS + LTE + battery controller: https://www.instructables.com/id/PiAnyWhere-4G-LTE-Hat-for-the-Raspberry-Pi/
