====== WritingTool ======
Created Thursday 25 April 2019

What do I want?

A key chord that brings up a window that can take text. When I'm done, escape closes the window - no need to save.

A sunlight readable screen, optimized for viewing text.

[[:Technology]] is a thing, but also [[:Habits]]

A device for writing on the go.

===== Design goals =====
* Portable
	* build into the body of an existing keyboard or maybe make it plug in?
* Minimal output
	* a small text display (maybe as little as a line)
