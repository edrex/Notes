===== Milestones =====

==== M1 publish ====
[*] Command to export
[*] Setup [[:Netlify]]
[*] Command to export+upload https://github.com/edrex/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/publish-notes

==== M2 auto publish ====
[*] Automate publish on change via a [[:Systemd:UserUnit]]
https://github.com/edrex/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/systemd/user

==== M3 edit online ====
[ ] Build via netlify CI rather than locally
[ ] Set laptop to pull --rebase && push
	[ ] on local change
	[ ] on login
	[ ] on connect (so when I open my laptop it syncs)
[ ] Ensure Zim updates index on remote change
[ ] Remove html branch

==== M4 fancy export ====
Idea: Zim => Markdown => Hugo publishing to enable fancy features
[ ] Question: Possible to create an export template that includes frontmatter?
[ ] Manually export site to markdown
[ ] Include markdown as subdir in local hugo build and see if there are any gotchas
[ ] If it works well, automate this two-step build on CI server

[ ] Modify template to link to source - direct to file if possible, otherwise repo root
